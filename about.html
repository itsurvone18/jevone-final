        My name is Jevone Cyrille G. Abinal, and I’m someone who has always been passionate about sports, physical activity,
         and spending time doing the things I love. Ever since I was young, I found myself drawn to different types of sports,
         especially football, badminton, and table tennis. I enjoy the competition, the teamwork, and the discipline that comes
         with every game I play. One of my proudest achievements was being part of the Palarong Pambansa back in 2019, where I
         competed in football representing my region. That year, the event was held in Davao City, and it was truly a
         life-changing experience to play at a national level and compete against some of the best athletes in the country.
         It taught me the value of hard work, determination, and never giving up. In addition to that, I was also a proud
         representative of Region V in the Palarong Bicol. In 2024, I joined the regional competition and brought home a
         silver medal another unforgettable milestone in my sports journey. These experiences have not only made me
         stronger as an athlete but have also shaped me into the person I am today. Aside from sports, I also enjoy
         a lot of different hobbies that help me relax and enjoy life. I love cooking, especially trying new recipes or 
         preparing food for my loved ones. Sleeping and resting are also important to me, especially after a long day of 
         school or training. Playing badminton is one of my favorite ways to stay active and have fun at the same time. 
         I also love riding my motorbike, which gives me a sense of freedom and adventure. Spending time with my girlfriend 
         is something I truly value, whether we’re just hanging out, talking, or going on walks together. 
         I also enjoy walking my dog, which helps me feel calm and connected to nature. And whenever 
         I have extra time, I play futsal to stay sharp and enjoy the sport I love. All of these things 
         are a part of who I am a student, an athlete, a dreamer, and someone who is constantly working 
         hard to grow, achieve more, and live a meaningful life.
