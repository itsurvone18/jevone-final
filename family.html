            <p> My name is <strong>Jevone Cyrille G. Abinal</strong>, and I come from a family that has always been my
          biggest source of strength and inspiration. My family may not be large, but the love, 
          support, and values they’ve given me are more than enough to keep me grounded and motivated in life. 
          I was raised by my mother, Grace Galimba, a strong and dedicated woman who has worked tirelessly to 
          give our family a better life. She is currently working as a supervisor in one of the call center agencies in Singapore
        , and her dedication to her job and to our family has always inspired me to be hardworking and responsible.
          My stepfather, Ian Svenska, is also an important figure in my life. 
          He works as a police officer and, like my mother, is currently based in Singapore. 
          Even though we are not together physically most of the time, I deeply appreciate his role in our family. 
          He has taken care of us and supported my dreams like his own. I also have a younger brother named Hyrille Lillo.
          He’s still small, but he brings so much joy and light to our family. Right now, he is living with my parents in Singapore,
          and I miss them every day. Currently, I am staying here in the Philippines by myself to finish my college education.
          I’m pursuing a degree in Information Technology, and it’s not always easy being away from my family.
          There are times when I feel alone or tired, but I always remind myself why I’m doing this.
          I want to finish my studies not just for my own success, but so I can finally be with my family in Singapore,
          contribute to our future, and be someone they can be proud of. I dream of being able to work alongside them 
          one day, and most importantly, to help them in return for all the sacrifices they’ve made for me. My mother 
          and stepfather have both worked hard abroad to support our needs, and I know how much they’ve given up just 
          to give me this opportunity. Their sacrifices taught me the value of hard work, perseverance, and love for family. 
          Even though we are apart, they are always in my heart, and they are the reason I push myself every single day.
          I also want to be a good role model for my younger brother, to show him that with determination and purpose, 
          he can achieve his dreams too. This is the story of my family a simple, hardworking, and loving family that may
          be far apart for now, but is always connected by love, sacrifice, and the shared dream of a better future together.</p>
