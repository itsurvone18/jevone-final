            <p> Hi! My name is <strong>Jevone Cyrille G. Abinal</strong>, I’m 19 years old, and I live in Masbate City. I was born and raised here,
       and I can proudly say that being a Masbateño is a big part of who I am. The culture, the people, and the life here shaped
       my character and taught me the values I carry today. Growing up in Masbate wasn’t always easy, but it made me strong and
       determined. I learned the importance of family, perseverance, and hard work in reaching my dreams. These values continue
       to guide me, especially now as I work toward finishing my degree in Information Technology. One of my biggest motivations
       in life is my girlfriend, Angelica. We’ve been together for five years now, and we’re still growing stronger. We share 
       the same dream: to finish our studies, build a better future together, and one day have a happy family of our own. We 
       also want to give back to our parents for all the sacrifices they’ve made for us. That dream keeps us going, no matter
       how hard things get. At 19, I know there’s still a long road ahead. I may not have all the answers, but with Angelica
       by my side and the lessons I’ve learned as a proud Masbateño, I’m confident we’ll make it. I believe that even coming
       from a small city, we can dream big, work hard, and achieve something truly meaningful not just for ourselves, but
       for the people we love. This is my story so far, and I’m excited to see where this journey takes us. </p>
